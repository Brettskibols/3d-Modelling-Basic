1. Camera changed to matrix and vertex as now its just a matrix - So it may effect it's use.

2. Check W and V values in matrices and Vertices and make sure that the values are not set to 1 from the get go, 
   it will effect cam position.

3. Check homogenize method as it greatly effects drawn verts.

4. Run watch lists of _transformedVertices at different method calls and check the values are changing.

5. Check final verts via watch list are the ones drawn.   

6. Check transformTransformedVertices does not call dehomogenize and it is only called by itself within render.

 - Above should be main problems.

World Transformation
Camera Transformation - FUCKED
Perspective Projection = (d / aspect ratio)
Dehomogenize = Divide all parts by W
Screen Transformation (ViewPoint Transformation)

AND . . . . . fix the transFormTransformed co-ordinates - ALSO FUCKED
